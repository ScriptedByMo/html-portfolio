<h1>My Best Movies</h1>
 
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my favourit movie. I love its powerful storytelling, strong performances , themes of hope 
and resilience, and its emotional impact.</p>

<h3>Batman: The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Its strengths include Heath Ledger's iconic performance as the Joker, a gripping and morally complex 
story, and intense action sequences. The film explores deep themes like chaos vs. order, morality, and 
the cost of heroism, making it one of the best superhero movies ever made.</p>

<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>Your Name is incredible! What I really loved about it is the way it mixes romance with fantasy and
drama. The story of two teens who swap bodies across time is so unique, and it kept me hooked from 
start to finish.</p>
